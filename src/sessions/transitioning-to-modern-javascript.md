Over 90% of web traffic comes from browsers that support modern JavaScript, yet most websites ship legacy syntax in order to support a small number of very old browsers.

We now have the ability to deliver modern and legacy code to browsers based on what they support, but this doesn't extend to the large amount of dependency code in our applications. Our dependencies are still published as verbose legacy syntax in order to support the lowest common denominator of browsers today.

This talk explains how legacy dependency code is one of the biggest performance problems on the web today, and what steps we can all take address it.
