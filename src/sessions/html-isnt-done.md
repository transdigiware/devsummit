Let's go back in time a bit. Remember when word was out that we were going to get new HTML elements? I don't know about you, but I was so excited. After years of building the same tabset over and over, I thought, I'm done! Surely they'll see that tabs are one of the most common elements in _every design system ever_. Imagine my disappointment. `<aside>`, `<article>`, and their friends seemed so disconnected from the problems I was solving every day. I had no problem with them, I just didn't need them.

Since then, I have held onto the core belief that HTML shouldn't be finished. Design Systems have been innovating and lighting the path forward for HTML for a long time. The web platform is now ready to pave those cow paths and extend HTML. And we need your help with these brand new shiny components!
